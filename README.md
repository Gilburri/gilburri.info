## About This Project

This repository is the home of **gilburri.info** — a living digital space dedicated to the true story of John Fahy, the Irish-born convict who escaped into Queensland’s frontier in 1841, was adopted by the Wakka Wakka and Gidhabal peoples, and reborn as **Gilburri**, the sacred bellbird totem of resurrection.

From an Aboriginal perspective, this is not just history — it is kinship, sovereignty, and cultural continuity. This site and repo exist to honour that truth, share the animation, and grow a community archive.
